Authors@R: person("Ewan", "Keith", email = "ewan.keith100@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: shinyShortcut provides a single function (of the same name) that, 
    when given the base directory of a shiny application, will produce an
    executable file that runs the shiny app directly in the user's
    default browser. Tested on both windows and unix machines. Inspired
    by and borrowing from
